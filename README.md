# Store

Data store for searching, sorting, and paginating items.

Store uses UMD, so it will work with globals, AMD, or CommonJS module exports.

## Getting Started

To install using bower:

	bower install clubajax/store --save

You may also use `npm` if you prefer. Or, you can clone the repository with your generic clone commands as a standalone 
repository or submodule.

	git clone git://github.com/clubajax/store.git

It is recommended that you set the config.path of RequireJS to make `store` accessible as an
absolute path.

Store has no dependencies.

## Description

Store can be used as a central repository for list of items. Individual items can be retrieved, or multiple items can be fetched.
